# Grid layouts to showcase your work

Image Grid sections are grid layouts that focus on imagery to create a strong visual impact. Use them to showcase your work, products, portfolio, offers, etc. - they're well suited for any type of email that requires images to reinforce your message.

---

## Columns With Captions

Great for displaying products or offers in an organized fashion. Choose from 2, 3, and 4-column variations.

## Logo Grid

The Logo Grid is a four-column grid layout, ideal for showing off partner or sponsor logos. On mobile, the logo columns go full width and stack.

### Masonry Grid With Captions

The Masonry Grid, but with captions for each image.

### Masonry Grid No Gutters

This variation removes the gutters between grid columns, so that your images stick to one another. The container gutters are preserved, to 'box' it in and align it with your text.

### Masonry Grid No Gutters - Full Width

Same as the one above, but with container gutters removed, so that you can use larger images and create more immersive visuals.

## Full Width Image

A simple, full width image. This is an inline image, not a background image. So unlike those, it will always be visible in full, because it's not dependent on its container height.

## Customisation

### Images

Simply change the `src=""` and `width=""` of each image. If you want use retina images, make sure your own image is twice the pixel size of the placeholder.

### Captions

Image Grids With Captions have linked text below the image, which you can customise by changing the default inline styles. Remember to update the links.

### Top & Bottom Spacing

Change the `line-height:` value on the `<div class="spacer"`. For mobile spacer customisation, learn more about [spacers in Acorn](https://thememountain.github.io/documentation/acorn/utilities/spacing.html).
