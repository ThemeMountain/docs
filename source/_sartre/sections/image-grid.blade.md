## Customisation

### Images

Simply change the `src=""` and `width=""` of each image. If you want use retina images, make sure your own image is twice the pixel size of the placeholder.

### Captions

Image Grids With Captions have linked text below the image, which you can customise by changing the default inline styles. Remember to update the links.

### Top & Bottom Spacing

Change the `line-height:` value on the `<div class="spacer"`. For mobile spacer customisation, learn more about [spacers in Acorn](https://thememountain.github.io/acorn/utilities/spacing.html).
