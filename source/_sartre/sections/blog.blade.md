# For all your blogging needs

Blog sections are grid layouts that focus on imagery and content. They are perfect for content-focused newsletters.

---

## Blog List

Compact design intended for newsletters that need to show many blog posts.

## Blog Podcast

Similar to the Blog List, but with a play button icon and episode length instead of comments.

## Blog Columns Boxed

The mandatory column(s) blog post design. Included are sections with up to 4 columns.

This is the default variant, where columns are visually grouped together and share the same background colour.

## Blog Columns Cards

The Cards are 'isolated' blog post columns that use the email body background colour in order to achieve a Polaroid-like or ...cards layout ðŸ™‚

## Blog Image Left/Right

Compact, with an image on the side, it's ideal if you need to show many posts but also have a short excerpt.

## Customisation

### Links

Change the HEX colour from the link's inline CSS.

### Icons

Retina icons supported, just [specify half the natural image width](https://docs.thememountain.com/acorn/images), as shown in Acorn.

Note: by default, some icons use emoji for alt text, like the ðŸ’­ or the ðŸ”’. Some email clients don't support emojis, so remember to consider your audience when using them.

### Background Colour

Change the HEX colour inside `bgcolor=""` on the `<td>`'s:

```html
<td class="px-sm-16" align="center" bgcolor="#EEEEEE">
    <table class="container" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" role="presentation" width="600">
        <tr>
            <td class="px-sm-8" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="padding: 0 24px;">
                ...
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</td>
```

Throughout the template, we use #EEEEEE for the 'outside' colour (basically, the email body), and #FFFFFF or #232323 for the inside of a section. When using the integrated versions, such as MailChimp or StampReady, you need not worry about this: controls for changing them are provided through their UI.

### Top & Bottom Spacing

Change the `line-height:` value on the `<div class="spacer"`: 

```html
<div class="spacer line-height-sm-0 py-sm-8" style="line-height: 24px;">&zwnj;</div>
```

For spacing on mobile, we generally use the `py-sm-8` class, that sets the spacer to be 16px high. You can change it to one of the other mobile spacing classes in Acorn. Learn more about [spacers in Acorn](https://docs.thememountain.com/acorn/utilities/spacing).
