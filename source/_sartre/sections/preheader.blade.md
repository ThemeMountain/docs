# Add useful information above your header

Preheader sections come in two types:

- Basic
- Social

They can be used to add aside information above the fold. The text inside will also show up in the email preview, so you can use them as attention grabbers.

## Basic Preheader

The Basic Preheader is made up of two columns with text links inside. If you want, you can replace the two columns with just one (12-col.html from the grid), and use only text.
