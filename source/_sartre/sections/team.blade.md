# Highlight your team members

A Team section is a great way to show the members that make up your team.

Sartre Email includes the following:

- Team 1
- Team 2 (Boxed)
- Team 2 (Full Width)

---

## Team 1

This section focuses on the whole team, by providing a large full width image and a call to action button that you can use to link to your About Us page, for example.

## Team 2 (Boxed)

Team 2 provides a two column layout that you can use to highlight a couple of your team members. It includes a short text, as well as social media icons, to link to their profiles.

On mobile, the two columns will stack on top of each other.

## Team 2 (Full Width)

Similar to its sibling, but with more space for your content.

## Customisation

### Text

Font size, colour, weight, spacing, all can be changed through inline CSS.

### Images

Simply change the `src=""` and `width=""` of each image. If you want use retina images, make sure your own image is twice the pixel size of the placeholder.

### Top & Bottom Spacing

Change the `line-height:` value on the `<div class="spacer"`. For mobile spacer customisation, learn more about [spacers in Acorn](https://thememountain.github.io/acorn/utilities/spacing.html).
