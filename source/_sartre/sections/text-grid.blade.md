# Flexible sections for all your content needs

As simple as they are, as useful they can be. We've extracted Acorn's [email grid](https://thememountain.github.io/acorn/layout/grid.html) into individual sections, so that you can use them to build any type of column combination the framework supports.

## Column Combinations

## Headline Centered

## Customisation

### Text

Font size, colour, weight, spacing, all can be changed through inline CSS.

### Top & Bottom Spacing

Change the `line-height:` value on the `<div class="spacer"`. For mobile spacer customisation, learn more about [spacers in Acorn](https://thememountain.github.io/acorn/utilities/spacing.html).
