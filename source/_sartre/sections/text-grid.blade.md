# Flexible sections for all your content needs

As simple as they are, as useful they can be. We've extracted Acorn's [email grid](https://thememountain.github.io/documentation/acorn/layout/grid.html) into individual sections, so that you can use them to build any type of column combination the framework supports.

## Column Combinations

Included are all Acorn grid column combinations:

- 1 column
- 2 columns
- 3 columns
- 4 columns
- 3:1 columns
- 1:3 columns

## Headline Centered

Basically a 1-column, but with pre-styled text and spacing.

## Customisation

### Text

Font size, colour, weight, spacing, all can be changed through inline CSS.

### Top & Bottom Spacing

Change the `line-height:` value on the `<div class="spacer"`: 

```html
<div class="spacer line-height-sm-0 py-sm-8" style="line-height: 24px;">&zwnj;</div>
```

For spacing on mobile, we generally use the `py-sm-8` class, that sets the spacer to be 16px high. You can change it to one of the other mobile spacing classes in Acorn. Learn more about [spacers in Acorn](https://thememountain.github.io/documentation/acorn/utilities/spacing.html).
