# Sections for all your vertical spacing needs

As a convenience, we've also extracted the Spacer and Divider components into individual sections.

Both come with Boxed and Full Width variations.

---

## Spacer - Boxed

The Boxed Spacer is basically a section with just a spacer inside the container. Being limited to the container's 600px width, you can use different background colours on the full width `class="wrapper"` and on the `class="container"`.

## Spacer - Full Width

Same as the Boxed one, only that the wrapper doesn't have a container inside - it just houses the Spacer directly.

## Divider - Boxed

A Divider component wrapped inside a container, in the same way the Boxed Spacer is.

## Divider - Full Width

A full width divider that will stretch from edge to edge in your email client's window or preview pane.

## Customisation

These sections use [Spacer](https://thememountain.github.io/documentation/acorn/components/spacer.html) and [Divider](https://thememountain.github.io/documentation/acorn/components/divider.html) components from our Acorn Email Framework.

In addition to those, you might find it useful to learn about [Wrappers](https://thememountain.github.io/documentation/acorn/layout/overview.html#wrapper) and [Containers](https://thememountain.github.io/documentation/acorn/layout/overview.html#container) in Acorn.
