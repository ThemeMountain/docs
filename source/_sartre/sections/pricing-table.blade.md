# Show plans or subscriptions in your emails

Use Pricing Table sections to get your subscribers to your sign-up page. They're perfect for a 'trial expired' notification, or a promotional event email.

Sartre Email comes with two main types of Pricing Tables:

- 2 columns
- 3 columns

Each type includes 3 variations.

---

## 2 Columns

These are well suited for simple pricing options.

## 3 Columns

A bit more complex and tight, these pricing tables are better suited for more complex pricing options.

## Customisation

### Text

Text size and colour can be styled through inline CSS.

### Background colour

Change the HEX colour in the `bgcolor=""` attribute.

### Borders

Borders are defined with inline CSS, simply change the pixel width, style, and colour.

### Buttons

Buttons can be customised with inline CSS. Read more in our [Button component](https://thememountain.github.io/acorn/components/buttons.html) framework docs.

### Top/bottom spacing

For table headings (i.e. the pricing plan name), spacing is achieved with CSS `padding`.

Top and bottom spacing is done with Acorn's [Universal Spacer component](https://thememountain.github.io/acorn/components/spacer.html#universal), which is added near the top and bottom of the section's HTML code. You can change the `line-height:` value on the `<div class="spacer"`. For mobile spacer customisation, learn more about [spacers in Acorn](https://thememountain.github.io/acorn/utilities/spacing.html).
