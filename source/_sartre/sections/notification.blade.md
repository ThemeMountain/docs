# For beautiful transactional emails

We have extracted each section from the [Notification Templates](../notification-templates), so that you can easily create your own transactional email templates.

---

## Order Item

For order confirmations or abandoned cart recoveries, use this section to show your customers what they've added to their order.

## Checkout Button

A button that is a section on its own, so you can easily add it in between other notification sections.

## Cart Items Headline

Simple, centered headline section that you can use above your order items list.

## Confirm Email

With a confirmation message and a button for your users to confirm their email. Can be used for any 'confirmation' needs.

## Intro Headline

A HERO-like intro for your transactional emails, with a cool gradient background colour that even works in Outlook! Comes with a button variation.

## Order Rating

The Star Rating section, adapted for a transactional email.

## Order Shipping Details

Two column layout that can be used to show shipping and billing address.

## Order Totals

Your shopping cart emails need to show the user how much they're about to spend. Use this.

## Password Reset

Similar to Confirm Email, but with an extra message at the bottom. It exists because of online builders limitations.
