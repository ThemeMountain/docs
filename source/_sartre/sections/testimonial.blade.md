# Need to show a user review or quote someone?

Easily add quotes or user reviews to your emails.

We've included the following variations:

- Twitter-style
- Left With Quote
- Split With Border
- 2 Columns Boxed
- Centered With Avatar

---

## Twitter-style

Quote a user from Twitter with this testimonial section that closely resembles the tweet card design.

## Left With Quote

Simple, left-aligned single column testimonial, with a quote icon and author name.

## Split With Border

A simple, typography focused and left aligned testimonial, with user name, a separating border, and a quote image that you can customise to suit your needs. The border is removed on mobile through the `borderless-sm` class.

## 2 Columns Boxed

Add a couple of user reviews, with a two column layout. Each box has its own user avatar image and background colour, which you can of course customise. On mobile, the columns will stack.

## Customisation

### Text

Font size, colour, weight, spacing, all can be changed through inline CSS.

### Images

Simply change the `src=""` and `width=""` of each image. If you want use retina images, make sure your own image is twice the pixel size of the placeholder.

### Top & Bottom Spacing

Change the `line-height:` value on the `<div class="spacer"`. For mobile spacer customisation, learn more about [spacers in Acorn](https://thememountain.github.io/acorn/utilities/spacing.html).
