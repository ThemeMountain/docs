### Added

* Row and Divider modules for CampaignMonitor all-in-one. CM doesn't allow modules with no editable content - this adds a workaround
* MailChimp: product recommendations sections

### Fixed

* Typography-related CSS causing issues with spacers/dividers in case your ESP does automatic CSS inlining
* Prevent responsive image code from potentially blowing up ESP tracking pixel

### Updated

* Typography. Beautiful default system fonts, less font-related CSS inlining
* Mailster paragraph ("multi") editing (prevents gaps caused by WordPress editor automatically inserting paragraphs)

### Removed

* "Auto content" Mailster functionality from modules with text in 2 or more columns (Mailster doesn't support this, yet)
* Redundant Mailster individual template files. Base and Notification can be used to easily create any combination
