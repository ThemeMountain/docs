# Other ESPs Compatibility Notes

Our templates work with most email service providers, even though a dedicated integration isn't included.
The reason we don't provide an integration for them is mainly because these services don't provide a templating language that we can use to integrate our templates with their editors.

You can, however, *upload the standard HTML version to these ESPs*, altough in some cases you will not be able to edit the content in a WYSIWYG editor, as it the case with the dedicated integrations we provide.

The following is a compatibility table that lists any issues we've encountered while testing, with advice on how to handle them.

## ESP-Specific

The following issues apply only to some email service providers. This is subject to change, depending on how ESPs change the way they handle HTML.
