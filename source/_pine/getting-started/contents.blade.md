## Components

Components are pre-built structures that you can drop into your projects right away. 
We have included 10+ components, ranging from the common spacer or divider, to interactive ones such as hamburger menus or accordions.

## Examples

Pine comes with examples that show how easy it is to use the framework in order to build structures for common scenarios, 
like [centering a single column](https://github.com/ThemeMountain/pine/blob/master/examples/1-col-centered-on-desktop.html) 
with very little code or defining a [custom stacking order for mobile-only](../utilities/reverse-stack).

## Grid

We have included grid examples that cover all possible column combinations. 
Simply drop them in the starter layout and use them to build your layouts.

## Layouts

The layouts folder contains the [starter layout](../pine/introduction/#starter-layout) file.
