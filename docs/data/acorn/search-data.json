Acorn comes with two and three-column pricing tables, each with a boxed and full-width version.\n\n2 Columns - Boxed\n\nWhen we say 'boxed pricing table', we mean it has 24px apparent padding on each side. It comes with call-to-action buttons that are placed outside the pricing tables themselves. On mobile, the columns will stack.\n\n        Preview\n        Code\n\n                @fileContents('source/img/icons/mobile.svg')\n                @fileContents('source/img/icons/desktop.svg')\n\n      &zwnj;\n\n                  Free Edition\n                  $0\n                  10GB Cloud Storage\n                  5 Galleries\n                  0 Add Ons\n                  0 Personalized Domains\n\n            &zwnj;\n\n                  Sign Up\n\n                  Pro Edition\n                  $6.95\n                  20GB Cloud Storage\n        ","path":"/acorn/components/pricing-table"},{"title":"Spacer","description":"Consistent vertical spacing for HTML emails","keywords":"spacer, gap, margin","body":"\nA reliable and flexible component for all your vertical spacing needs\n\nVertical spacing in emails can be tricky, because of inconsistent support for margins, padding, and `` tags. The Spacer component in Acorn helps create consistent vertical spacing between and inside Wrappers and Rows, and inside Columns.\n\nThere are 3 types of Spacers:\n\nUniversal\nTable\nRow\n\nUniversal\n\nThis is the most flexible Spacer component. Being a `, it can be used anywhere such an element is allowed. In our case: before/after tables, inside  / , or inside other ` elements.\n\nThe height of an Universal Spacer is defined by the line-height value from the inline CSS.\n\nOn mobile, Universal Spacers are reset to 0 height, to allow for greater customisation flexibility. As can be seen in the examples, we can use inline height: CSS to keep the desktop height, or we can use mobile spacing utility classes to define a different height for the Spacer on mobile.\n\n        Preview\n        Code\n\n                @fileContents('","path":"/acorn/components/spacer"},{"title":"Stats","description":"Show number statistics in HTML email","keywords":"count, followers, numbers","body":"\nCountless countable things\n\nThe Stats component can be used to display various countable things, like a followers count or projects completed.\n\nBasic Text Left\n\nBasic Text Left Stats is a 3-column module that has columns separated with a vertical border, and text aligned to the left.
